There is no Makefile for this exercise, assuming that you just inine all the function implementations in the .h files.

To compile, just type:

  g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic main.cpp -o main

You may create Aclass.ccp and Bclass.cpp files to do your implementations, in which case you'll need to add them to your compile command (or create a Makefile).
