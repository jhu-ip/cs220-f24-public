Write these functions in the int_set.cpp file:

operator<<
destructor
copy constructor
operator+=
operator=

You can test with main1, but will need to gradually uncomment some sections as
you have implemented the above functions.

Also be sure to run valgrind to check for memory leaks and correct any found.
